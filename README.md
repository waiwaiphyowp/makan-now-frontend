- As a customer, I want to review my cart and modify the quantities or remove items before proceeding to checkout.

- As a customer, I want to proceed to checkout after reviewing my cart, so I can complete my order.

- As a customer, I want to receive a queue number after checkout, so I can wait for my order to be prepared and served.

## Workflow Process
  ### Browse Food Items
    - The customer accesses a page displaying available food items.

  ### Add Items to Cart:
    - Customers select food items and add them to their cart 
    - The cart is dynamically updated with each addition, showing items, quantities, and total price.

  ### Checkout
    - Once the customer is ready to checkout, they review the items in the cart.
    - After confirming the items, they click "Checkout."

  ### Queue Number Generation
    - After checkout, the system generates a unique queue number for the customer.
      The queue number is returned by the backend and displayed to the customer on the screen.
